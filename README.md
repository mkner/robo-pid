**Project template for both python packages & Read The Docs**

Basic directory structures and template files for building both python pypi\
packages and documentation for RTD (Read The Docs) using the sphinx theme.

This set of example directories and files actually build *both* RTD and PYPI!

Python package release v0.01.09 is here: https://pypi.org/project/new-pyproject/

RTD documentation is here: https://new-pyproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
